# Third Year Dissertation
### Large Scale In-Silico Clinical Trials: Developing a Workflow to Generate Boundary Conditions for Simulating a Functional Spinal Unit.
Due to the incredible expense of clinical trials on modern medical devices, computer simulation has been increasingly used to reduce costs. These computer simulations can be incredibly time consuming for researchers to perform as they require manual editing of the simulation files and the researcher to individually generate the boundary conditions. If the research team wanted to perform simulations on only 100 digital individuals, the programming time would take weeks of skilled labour.  To mitigate these issues and to facilitate truly large scale In-Silico Clinical Trials (ISCTs) I was tasked with developing a python workflow to automate the process. The finished workflow could: generate appropriate boundary conditions that varied with respect to the target populations; perform all the formatting and editing for the simulation files and output all the meaningful data in an easy to interpret way. Included in this portfolio is a copy of my submitted dissertation. Attached to the end of this file is the technical documentation for the operation of the script.
# Concrete Crack Detector
Uses a neural net trained and tested on 40,000 images to detect cracks in concrete. Has a validation accuracy of greater than 99.6%.

# Parks in London Project
This project has two files, a pdf lab report and the code used formated into a Jupyter Notebook, so that all the outputs can be seen without executing the file again.
The aim of this project was to build a linear regression model using the data from existing parks in London, that could then be used to predict visitor numbers to a  number of hypothetical parks.

# Covid App
As a final project for a course I had to develop an app, that displayed data from the John Hopkins University about the Covid 19 pandemic across every country. If you wish to run this app, there is a zip file containing the data (correct at time of development) and a mlapp file that will run on MATLAB. If you do not have a MATLAB file there is also a standalone version. However this file is much larger and hence cannot be uploaded into this portfolio, but is available upon request.

# Change Identification
The livescript demonstrates the code implemented to identify US change (quarters, nickels and dimes) from a photo, and then find the combined value. A PDF version is also included that shows all the outputs.
