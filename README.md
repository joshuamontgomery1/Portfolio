# Portfolio
The repository contains projects and code I wish to showcase.

# Concrete Crack Detector
Uses a neural net trained and tested on 40,000 images to detect cracks in concrete. Has a validation accuracy of greater than 99.6%.

# Parks in London Project
This project has two files, a pdf lab report and the code used formated into a Jupyter Notebook, so that all the outputs can be seen without executing the file again.
The aim of this project was to build a linear regression model using the data from existing parks in London, that could then be used to predict visitor numbers to a  number of hypothetical parks.

# Covid App
As a final project for a course I had to develop an app, that displayed data from the John Hopkins University about the Covid 19 pandemic across every country. If you wish to run this app, there is a zip file containing the data (correct at time of development) and a mlapp file that will run on MATLAB. If you do not have a MATLAB file there is also a standalone version. However this file is much larger and hence cannot be uploaded into this portfolio, but is available upon request.
